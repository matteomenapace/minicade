        <h1>Minicade</h1>
        <p>Minicade makes it super easy to collaboratively create an arcade of mini games with your friends. Each person can add a link to one or more mini games to the Minicade and instantly play them as one massive game. The framework even allows games to have levels so they can increase in difficulty the more you play.</p>

    <h1>Mini Game Jam</h1>
    <p>Don't know where to start when you are making your mini games? Invite your friends over for a Mini Game Jam. Make sure everyone has a laptop (and some pizza) and that people are split in teams of two to four people. Then give them a ridiculous theme, like dancing bananas or unicorn misfits. Ask your friends to spend 40-60 minutes making a mini game; that is a game that has a very simple and often ridiculous mechanic&mdash;think <em>Wario</em> or <em>Dumb Ways To Die</em>. Once you are done, make sure everyone shares what they made. Use another 30 minutes to fine-tune your game mechanics and art. Once everyone feels happy with their game, combine everything in your minicade.</p>
